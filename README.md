~~I enjoy finding creative solutions to complex problems~~

I'm a mostly self-taught developer with genuine interest in technology. These are not just empty words, I [rice Linux](https://excaliburzero.gitbooks.io/an-introduction-to-linux-ricing/content/ricing.html) and do [CTFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) for fun for crying out loud.

When it comes to my tech stack, I don't really have one. As long as you give me a [GC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)), I can make do with basically anything.
